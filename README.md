The goal of this project is to classify 9 different mexican food by looking a picture.

Everything you need to recreate this project is on the jupyter notebook. Everything was coded in Google Colab, because of its GPU. I uploaded the dataset to Google Drive, so you can download it directly. For more details, the notebook includes the instructions to follow.
